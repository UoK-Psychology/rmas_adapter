This is the script that you will use to create your new rmas_adapter skeleton.
It will use the adapter_template to create a new adapter, which provides you with
the runner script that allows you to start your adapter polling, and the settings file
where you specify the connection details to connect to the rmas bus, and which rmas events
you want to respond to.
